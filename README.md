# ieeevr_twitter

This project provides the logic to pull four tweets involving a certain hashtag from a custom server and display them in
a grid-like fashion using Vuejs. Its creation was intended for use at the IEEE Virtual Reality conference, where tweets
about the conference would be polled in real time and rendered into an image texture to be displayed on a virtual screen
in the virtual conference hall. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```


### To compile the code for production, run
